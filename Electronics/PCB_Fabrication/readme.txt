RS274X format gerber files for the fabrication of BoHv1_0 PCB.

Double layer PCB 4350mils x 2500 mils, standard FR4, 1.6mm thickness
Usable with 1oz Copper thickness, but 2oz preferred. Min 12mil(0.3mm) vias and 10 mil(0.25mm)tracks, 
Solder paste, Solder mask, Silk screen and signal layers (for top and bottom) along with drill files, all generated with KiCad.

KiCad files in PCB_Layout folder, can be used to modify and regenerate the gerber files.

All drawbacks of v0.1 PCB taken care of but the v1.0 is yet to be manufactured.
