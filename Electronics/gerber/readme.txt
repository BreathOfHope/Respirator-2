RS274X format gerber files for PCB fabrication
Double layer PCB 4100mils x 2500 mils, standard FR4, 1.6mm thickness
Usable with 1oz Copper thickness, but 2oz preferred. Min 8mil vias and tracks, 
Solder paste, Solder mask, Silk screen and signal layers (for top and bottom) along with drill files

Engineering Changes needed for use with Arduino Nano:  Short A4 to A6 and A5 to A7 on solder side at the Nano connector if the rotary encoder is to be used with Nano. 
No changes needed for Uno.
