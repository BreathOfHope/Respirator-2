Schematics file (.sch) to be used with KiCad, if you need to update the PCB, else use the pdf for viewing.
This is the enhanced version of the BoHv0.1 schematics with changes including
- usage of A4-A5 pins instead of A6-A7 for rotary encoder(knob) connection to Arduino Nano
- interrupt pin D2 used instead of D7 for position sense from optical sensor
- interrupt pin D3, PWM pin D10, ADC inputs A6 and A7 as expansion points

PCB yet to be manufactured but minimal changes made to v0.1 (as above).
